3️⃣ Activate Conda

After installation finishes:

source ~/.bashrc

4️⃣ Verify Conda Installation
conda --version


If Conda prints a version number, installation was successful ✅

🔹 Step 2: Create a Clean Bioinformatics Environment
1️⃣ Create and Activate Environment
conda create -n bioenv python=3.11
conda activate bioenv

2️⃣ Configure Conda Channels
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
